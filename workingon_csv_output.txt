SAGITTARIUS - The upside is that there's a beautiful garden growing from you.
SCORPIO - All you need is love. &amp; a military-grade gas mask. &amp; bottled water. &amp; several months of rations. That and love is all you need.
LIBRA - Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads. (We're going to die &amp; decompose someday, so roads will be unnecessary at that point.)
VIRGO - You have been granted three wishes. I mean infinite. I mean condemned to. I mean lives. You've been condemned to infinite lives.
LEO - The coroner finally completed your autopsy. It took weeks of reconstruction, but we've learned a lot about what happened.
CANCER - Don't shoot the messenger. Shoot the microchip controlling him. It's on his temple. Aim caref-- Nope! More carefully than that.
GEMINI - Some people believe in aliens, but then other people ARE aliens using mind control. Don't forget who you are, Gemini.
TAURUS - Before you can love other people, you must first learn to love the authoritarian reptile overlords who mandate your worship.
ARIES - If you love something, set it free. If it starts flying around and chirping, it was probably a bird.
PISCES - Ever wondered what it's like to die? Shame you'll never know. You are cursed to drift about space for eternity.
AQUARIUS - Look in your heart for the answer. (The answer involves a whole lot of blood.)
CAPRICORN - If you believe in infinite possible universes, then there's a world where you don't have a wolf spider on your shirt right now.

ARIES: He sure is a happy camper. That man in the shadow's edge of the woods just grins and grins.
PISCES: Meet the man of your dreams: a capuchin with a literal organ grinder &amp; expressionless eyes that stare right into you.
AQUARIUS: When God closes a door, he opens a window. But the swarm is still getting in. Close it. Close the window!
CAPRICORN: There's no such thing as a free lunch. There's no thing. There's nothing. Not a single thing exists.
SAGITTARIUS: There's a special place in hell for people like you. They're all exactly like you in every way. Thousands of them.
SCORPIO: Money doesn't grow on trees. Your progeny do. You're a tree now. We wish we knew which one. We miss you.
LIBRA: Get into a good book. Get in there &amp; embrace your new home of ink &amp; pulp. Be forgotten on the shelf above the TV. Never return.
VIRGO: Aim for the moon. Because even if you miss, you'll still die cold and alone in a silent vacuum.
LEO: There are many organ donors. You can also register as an organ collector. You'll need some clay jars and a good marker.
CANCER: There's a bird here that claims to know you. Says you're related. The bird said this with its eyes. Birds can't talk.
