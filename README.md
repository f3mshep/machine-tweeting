## machine-tweeting
This space reserved for my future twitter bot powered by Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

# Goal
This folder will contain mostly python resources to harvest tweets from twitter accounts, process the data in preparation for training, and interface with the Twitter API to post tweets. I will be using a torch-rnn to train a model based on the harvested tweets, and to generate text output. While my goal is to create a WelcomeToNightvale bot, this project is designed to be modular. After installing a torch-rnn virtualenv, it should be possible to produce any kind of twitter bot, provided the training materials are adequately long enough.
